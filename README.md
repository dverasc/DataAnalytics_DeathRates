# DataAnalytics_DeathRates

In this notebook, I explored and drilled down a dataset that has drug related death statistics for all 50 states spanning a period of 6 years (2010-16). The data set has rates for both males and females and has further categories for race and Hispanic/not Hispanic. I turned the csv file into a Panda datafram and then went on and further drilled down by state (focused on Florida), focusing on Hispanics and then created two different pie charts (one for males, another for females). I used pandas and matplotlib for manipulating and visualizing.

Conclusion: Interestingly enough, the year with the highest drug rate death was 2016 for both male and female latinx victims in Florida.
